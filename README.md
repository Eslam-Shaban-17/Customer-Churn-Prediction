## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction

```

1. **Create virtual environment (recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

```

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

1. **Download the dataset**

```bash
# Option 1: Using Kaggle API
kaggle datasets download -d blastchar/telco-customer-churn
unzip telco-customer-churn.zip -d data/raw/

# Option 2: Manual download
# Download from Kaggle link above and place in data/raw/

```

### Running the Project

**Option 1: Run complete pipeline**

```bash
python main.py

```

**Option 2: Run Jupyter notebooks sequentially**

```bash
jupyter notebook
# Open and run notebooks in order: 01 → 02 → 03

```

**Option 3: Run individual components**

```bash
# Data preprocessing
python src/data_preprocessing.py

python src/model_evaluation.py

```

## 📈 Results

### Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Logistic Regression | 80.3% | 66% | 53.4% | 59.0% | 0.847 |
| Random Forest | 80.1% | 66.7% | 50.1% | 55.8% | 0.835 |

### Key Insights

1. **Contract Type** is the strongest predictor of churn
    - Month-to-month contracts: 42% churn rate
    - Two-year contracts: 3% churn rate
2. **Tenure** inversely correlates with churn
    - Customers < 6 months: Highest risk
    - Customers > 2 years: Lowest risk
3. **Payment Method** impacts retention
    - Electronic check users churn 45% more
4. **Additional Services** reduce churn
    - Tech support reduces churn by 15%
    - Online security reduces churn by 12%

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values in TotalCharges
- Encoded categorical variables (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
- Split data: 80% training, 20% testing

### 2. Feature Engineering

- Created tenure groups (0-1 year, 1-2 years, 2+ years)
- Calculated average monthly charge
- Created service count feature
- Generated interaction features

### 3. Model Training

- Implemented multiple algorithms
- Applied cross-validation (5-fold)
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Handled class imbalance with SMOTE

### 4. Evaluation

- ROC-AUC score as primary metric
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Feature importance visualization
- Business metric translation

## 💡 Business Recommendations

1. **Retention Program for New Customers**
    - Implement onboarding campaigns for customers in first 6 months
    - Offer incentives at 3-month and 6-month milestones
2. **Contract Migration Strategy**
    - Incentivize month-to-month customers to upgrade to annual contracts
    - Offer discounts for long-term commitments
3. **Payment Method Optimization**
    - Encourage automatic payment methods
    - Provide incentives for switching from electronic checks
4. **Value-Added Services Promotion**
    - Bundle tech support with internet services
    - Cross-sell security features to at-risk segments
5. **Proactive Intervention**
    - Deploy model to score customers monthly
    - Trigger retention campaigns for high-risk customers (>60% churn probability)
